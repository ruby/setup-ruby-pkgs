# setup-ruby-pkgs

Cross platform action that installs Ruby, along with tools and packages needed for compiling.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If one is using Actions image 'windows-2022' or later, [ruby/setup-ruby]
installs all packages needed to compile/build Windows Rubies, versions 2.5 and later.
Hence, if you don't need any additional tools or packages, please use [ruby/setup-ruby].

The action's inputs are shown below:

```yaml
- uses: ruby/setup-ruby-pkgs@v1
  with:
    ruby-version:      # passed to ruby/setup-ruby
    bundler:           #   "    "   "     "    "
    bundler-cache:     #   "    "   "     "    "
    cache-version:     #   "    "   "     "    "
    rubygems:          #   "    "   "     "    "

    brew:              # macOS
    mingw:             # Windows mingw / mswin /ucrt
    msys2:             #         mingw / mswin /ucrt
    mswin:             # Windows mswin - installs MSYS packages
    choco:             #         mswin
    vcpkg:             #         mswin
```

## Input Information

Information on inputs passed to [ruby/setup-ruby] is contained in its [README] and
[action.yml] files.

All inputs are optional.

### apt-get: (Ubuntu)

List of packages to install.  Space delimited. Special options are `_update_`, `_upgrade_`, and `_dist-upgrade_`.

If `_upgrade_` or `_dist-upgrade_` are included, `_update_` will also be done.

If neither is included and you're just installing  package(s), `_update_` WILL NOT BE DONE unless it's included.


### brew: (macOS)

List of packages to install.  Space delimited. Special options are `_update_` and `_upgrade_`, and both work similar to `apt-get:`.

### mingw: (Windows)

* **Ruby 2.4 & later**<br/>
  List of MSYS2 MinGW packages to install.<br/>
  Space delimited.  The package prefix (`mingw-w64-x86_64-` or `mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-`) is not required.<br/>
  If `_upgrade_` is included in the input, all packages needed by the gcc tools are updated.<br/>
  If `openssl` is included, an appropriate package will be installed.

* **Ruby 2.3 & earlier**<br/>
  The following DevKit packages are available:<br/>
    * libffi-3.2.1
    * openssl-1.0.2j
    * ragel-6.7
    * sqlite-3.7.15.2  (sqlite3)
    * zlib-1.2.8

### msys2: (Windows)

* **Ruby 2.4 & later**<br/>
  List of MSYS2 packages to install.  Space delimited.  These are command line utilities and are rarely needed.

* **Ruby 2.3 & earlier**<br/>
  No action, as no utilities are available for the older MSYS/DevKit.

### mswin: (Windows)

Installs MSYS2 packages.  These are typically build utilities, such as bison, ragel, etc.
As in pacman, MinGW packages must be prefixed with `mingw-w64-x86_64-` or `mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-`.

### choco: (Windows)

List of packages to install.  Space delimited.  Most packages are compiled with msvc, so normally used with mswin builds.
Currently, the mswin Ruby build is compiled using [microsoft/vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) packages, so
use of choco packages is discouraged.

### vcpkg: (Windows)

List of packages to install.  Space delimited.  All packages are compiled with msvc, so normally used with mswin builds.  An environment variable `OPT_DIR` is set to
```ruby
"--with-opt-dir=#{ENV['VCPKG_INSTALLATION_ROOT']}/installed/x64-windows"
```

After install, the tools folder is checked, and if any files are present, it is added to path.
